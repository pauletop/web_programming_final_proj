# Introduction
Welcome to the `README.md` file of the `Web Programming and Apllication` project. This project is a part of the course `Web Programming and Application` at the Ton Duc Thang University. The project is about creating a website for a job portal. The website will be used by the students and the employers to find the jobs and the employees respectively. The website will have the following features:
> Main Features:
- The students can register and login to the website.
- The students can search for the jobs (logged in or not) and apply for them (logged in).
- The students can create their curriculum vitae (CV), it just in very simple format, and upload it to the website or download it.
- The students can bookmark the jobs that they are interested in (logged in).
- The employers can register and login to the website.
- The employers can post the jobs (logged in) and view the applications for the jobs (logged in).
- The employers can view the CVs of the students who have applied for the jobs (logged in) and reply to them.
> Design Features:
- The website will have a simple and user-friendly interface.
- The website will be responsive and mobile-friendly.
- The website will have a good performance.
- We will use the `Bootstrap` framework for the design of the website (note: from online resources, so make sure to keep internet connection on while running the website).

The Figma design of the website can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/G335GVODKu1CjZSJeRg1vL/project_cv?t=P3r9rV8VSMEQV3zH-1)

# How to run the project
In basic code, we use `XAMPP` to run the project. So, you need to install `XAMPP` first. Then, you can follow the following steps to run the project:
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Copy the project folder to the `htdocs` folder of the `XAMPP` installation directory.
3. Start the `XAMPP` server and open the `phpMyAdmin` in the browser.
4. Create a new database with the name `projectcv`.
5. Import the `database.sql` file to the `projectcv` database.
6. Open the browser and route to the project folder to run `index.php` file.

It's done. You can now test the website.
